Hi,

Created this project using HTML, SCSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP.

I know react.js as well but I didn,t wanted to complicate the project further,
as this is my first ever project using PHP and MYSQL.

Check my react projects-
https://to-do-task-list.netlify.app
https://reactrobos.netlify.app
 

I have experience working with Node.js and MongoDB.

Check Extra Folder to have a look at (PHP , JQUERY) files I created 
during practice and learn basics.

I Learnt a lot while creating this project. Got stuck many times but 
with my will power I managed to finish this project.

I have taken help from -

Stackoverflow.
Official  Documentations.
Various Articles on web.


Hope you like this Project. I tried my best.

As I developed my mass delete functionality based on click event. So .checked = true(Test) will fail.
To pass the test I made some adjustment to check event listener. Check it out.
